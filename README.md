## Description

`Input Mask` is an [Android](https://github.com/RedMadRobot/input-mask-android) & [iOS](https://github.com/RedMadRobot/input-mask-ios) native library allowing to format user input on the fly.

The library provides you with a text field listener; when attached, it puts separators into the text while user types it in, and gets rid of unwanted symbols, all according to custom predefined pattern.

This allows to reformat whole strings pasted from the clipboard, e.g. turning pasted `8 800 123-45-67` into  
`8 (800) 123 45 67`.

Each pattern allows to extract valuable symbols from the entered text, returning you the immediate result with the text field listener's callback when the text changes. Such that, you'll be able to extract `1234567` from `8 (800) 123 45 67` or `19991234567` from `1 (999) 123 45 67` with two different patterns.

All separators and valuable symbol placeholders have their own syntax. We call such patterns "masks".

Mask examples:

1. International phone numbers: `+1 ([000]) [000] [00] [00]`
2. Local phone numbers: `([000]) [000]-[00]-[00]`
3. Names: `[A][-----------------------------------------------------]` 
4. Text: `[Aâ€¦]`
5. Dates: `[00]{.}[00]{.}[9900]`
6. Serial numbers: `[AA]-[00000099]`
7. IPv4: `[099]{.}[099]{.}[099]{.}[099]`
8. Visa card numbers: `[0000] [0000] [0000] [0000]`
9. MM/YY: `[00]{/}[00]`
10. UK IBAN: `GB[00] [____] [0000] [0000] [0000] [00]`
